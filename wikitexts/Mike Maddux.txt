Michael Ausley Maddux (born August 27, 1961) is an American professional baseball coach and former pitcher. He is the pitching coach for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for nine teams, over 15 seasons, and coached for four teams following his playing career.
Maddux played in MLB from 1986 through 2000 for the Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres, New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, Montreal Expos, and Houston Astros. Except for the Phillies, for whom he played during the first four seasons of his career, he never played more than two seasons for any team.
Maddux has served as pitching coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, Texas Rangers, Washington Nationals, and St. Louis Cardinals. Teams that hired him subsequently allowed fewer runs to score. While coaching for the Rangers, the pitching staff posted season earned run averages (ERA) lower than 4.00 for the first time since 1990, doing so for four consecutive seasons. The Nationals hired him after the 2015 season, and the Cardinals hired him after the 2017 season. He is the older brother of Hall of Fame pitcher Greg Maddux.
