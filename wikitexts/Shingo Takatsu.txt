Shingo Takatsu (高津 臣吾, Takatsu Shingo) (born November 25, 1968) is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher and manager. He had a short stint with the Chicago White Sox where he was the closer for two seasons until struggles closing games ultimately led to his demotion to the minors. Despite being demoted in the summer of 2005, he received a World Series ring with the White Sox. He was signed by the New York Mets during the 2005 season, and he pitched in nine games for New York. After the 2005 season, he returned to the Nippon Professional Baseball.
He is known by the nickname "Mr. Zero" because he did not give up a single run in 11 Japan Series games. In the 2004 season, his entrance in home games was accompanied by a video montage and a loud gong.
Shingo Takatsu, like many Japanese pitchers, has incorporated pauses into his pitching mechanics in order to throw off batters' timing. His arm angle varies from sidearm to submarine.
