Facing southpaw Dennis Bennett, he reached based on an error by second baseman Tony Taylor. Four days later, he hit his only major-league home run, a three-run smash against Jim O'Toole of the Cincinnati Reds that was a key blow in a 5–2 triumph, one of the Mets' 40 victories during their historically futile maiden MLB season. His final major league appearance came on September 26, 1962, when he collected two hits, including a double, in three at bats against Denny Lemaster of the Braves, his original team.In all, Herrscher batted .220 with six runs batted in in 50 MLB at bats; his 11 hits included three doubles and his August 5 home run. In the field, he started six games at first base, three at second base and one at shortstop. He made two errors in 104 total chances for a fielding percentage of .981.  He returned to the minors in 1963 and 1964 before leaving baseball.
Herrscher also played professional basketball for the Long Beach Chiefs/Hawaii Chiefs in 1961–1963.
