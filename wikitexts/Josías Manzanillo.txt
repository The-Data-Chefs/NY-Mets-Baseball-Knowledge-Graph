Josías Manzanillo Adams (born October 16, 1967) is a Dominican former Major League Baseball pitcher who played in the major leagues from 1991 to 2004.
In 1997, Manzanillo suffered a grisly injury while pitching for the Seattle Mariners. Not wearing a protective cup, he was struck in the groin by a line drive off the bat of Manny Ramírez which ruptured his testicles. Manzanillo managed to recover the baseball, throw out Jim Thome at home plate and sprint off the field under his own power before undergoing emergency reconstructive surgery.On December 13, 2007, Manzanillo was one of many athletes mentioned in the detailed Mitchell Report by former Senator George Mitchell. In the report, former New York Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski claimed that in 1994 Manzanillo asked Radomski to inject him with the steroid Deca-Durabolin, which Radomski did. Radomski stated that he remembered the event clearly because it was the only time he ever injected a player with steroids, and indeed the only time he actually saw a player use steroids. Manzanillo denied ever having used performance-enhancing drugs, saying that he once paid Radomski $200–$250 for one cycle of steroids but then "chickened out or thought better of it" and never took possession of the drugs.
