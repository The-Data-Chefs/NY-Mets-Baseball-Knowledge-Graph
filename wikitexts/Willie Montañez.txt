Guillermo Montañez Naranjo (born April 1, 1948) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball first baseman, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the California Angels (1966), Philadelphia Phillies (1970–1975, 1982), San Francisco Giants (1975–1976), Atlanta Braves (1976–1977), New York Mets (1978–1979), Texas Rangers (1979), San Diego Padres (1980), Montreal Expos (1980–1981), and Pittsburgh Pirates (1981-1982). He batted and threw left-handed.
Along with Tito Fuentes, Montañez was most noted for being one of MLB's two most flamboyant personalities during the 1970s, so much so that he was labeled a hot dog by detractors. He once commented, “I don't mind being called a hot dog, but it all depends on how people say it."
