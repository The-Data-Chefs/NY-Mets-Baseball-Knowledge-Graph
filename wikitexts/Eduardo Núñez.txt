He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Minnesota Twins, San Francisco Giants, Boston Red Sox, and the New York Mets. He also played for the Fubon Guardians of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) for one year. Although shortstop is his primary position, Núñez serves as a utility infielder, and played in the outfield for the Yankees as well.
The Yankees signed Núñez as an international free agent in 2004. He played minor league baseball in their organization from 2005 through 2010, until he made his MLB debut with the Yankees on August 19, 2010. Due to struggles and inconsistency, Núñez was designated for assignment by the Yankees at the start of the 2014 season. He was traded to the Twins, and enjoyed a breakout season in 2016, when he was named to appear in the MLB All-Star Game. He was traded to the Giants in 2016, and to the Red Sox in 2017. In July 2019, Núñez was designated for assignment and then released by the Red Sox. He signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets in 2020.
