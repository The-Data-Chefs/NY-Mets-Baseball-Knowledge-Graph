David Vincent Segui, (; born July 19, 1966) is an American former Major League Baseball first baseman.
Segui was born in Kansas City, Kansas, the son of former Major League baseball pitcher Diego Segu√≠. He played collegiate baseball for Louisiana Tech and Kansas City Kansas Community College. During a 15-year baseball career, Segui played with the Baltimore Orioles, New York Mets, Montreal Expos, Seattle Mariners, Toronto Blue Jays, Texas Rangers and Cleveland Indians.
In 1456 games over 15 seasons, Segui posted a .291 batting average (1412-for-4847) with 683 runs, 284 doubles, 139 home runs, 684 RBI, 524 bases on balls, .359 on-base percentage and .443 slugging percentage. He recorded a .995 fielding percentage primarily as a first baseman, but also played 100 games at left and right field.
Segui was identified by Jason Grimsley as one of the players who had taken human growth hormone during his major league career (he was one of the players whose name was redacted on Grimsley's document). Unlike others, however, Segui had a doctor's prescription for HGH to counter a deficiency he had been diagnosed with, and had previously admitted to using them.
Segui has also admitted to using anabolic steroids during his career with the Mets, obtaining them from former clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski. Segui never had any spikes in his performances or home runs, but says he knows about other ballplayers' usage. He was included in the Mitchell Report, which named people who were found using either HGH, steroids, or some other type of PEDs.
