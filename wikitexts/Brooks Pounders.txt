Brooks Casey Pounders (born September 26, 1990) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He attended Temecula Valley High School in Temecula, California, and chose not to attend college after he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2009.  After playing in the minor leagues for the Pirates, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals after the 2011 season.  While in the Royals' minor league system, Pounders threw a no-hitter for the Northwest Arkansas Naturals in 2013.  He made his major league debut with the Royals in 2016, and he was traded to the Los Angeles Angels after the season ended.
Pounders spent 2017 alternating between the Angels' major league club and the minor leagues, before becoming a free agent at the end of the season.  Before the 2018 season, Pounders signed a contract with the Colorado Rockies and played for both the Rockies and their Triple A-level affiliate.  Again a free agent after the 2018 season, Pounders signed with the Cleveland Indians, but never played a major league game with the team.  On June 15, he was traded to the New York Mets and immediately became part of the Mets' major league team.  He played briefly with the team before being sent back down to the minor league Syracuse Mets.  Pounders has not played in the major leagues since, despite briefly being in the Tampa Bay Rays system in 2020.  He was part of the United States national baseball team in the 2015 and 2019 WBSC Premier12 tournaments.
