Mack Daniel Sasser (born August 3, 1962), nicknamed "The Hacker", is an American former professional baseball catcher who played in Major League Baseball from 1987 through 1995 for the San Francisco Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Mets and Seattle Mariners. 
Sasser is known for the difficulty he regularly encountered in "double clutching" balls to the pitcher that had been thrown to him, although he performed competently as a catcher otherwise. He appeared in 534 games in his career, getting 317 hits with sixteen home runs, 156 runs batted in and a career .267 batting average.
