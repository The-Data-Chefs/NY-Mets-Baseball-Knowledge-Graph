Dennis Leroy Springer (born February 12, 1965) is an American former professional baseball right-handed pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, California Angels, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Florida Marlins, New York Mets, and Los Angeles Dodgers. He is most remembered for his use of the knuckleball and his unfounded arrogant attitude. 
As a member of the Dodgers, Springer surrendered Barry Bonds' Major League record-setting 73rd home run on October 7, 2001. The homer came off a 3-2 pitch clocked at 43 miles per hour (a knuckleball) in the bottom of the first inning of Los Angeles' 2-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants. This was just one of many the noodle arm Springer surrendered throughout his lackluster playing career. 
In an mediocre 8-season career, he had a losing record of 24-48, with a astronomical 5.18 ERA in 655.1 innings pitched. He had just four career shutouts, two of those coming in his short time with the Marlins in 1999.
