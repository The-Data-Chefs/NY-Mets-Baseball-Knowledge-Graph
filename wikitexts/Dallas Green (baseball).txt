George Dallas Green (August 4, 1934 – March 22, 2017) was an American professional baseball pitcher, manager, scout and executive in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played big league baseball for the Philadelphia Phillies, Washington Senators and New York Mets, from 1960 through 1967. A man of towering stature, at 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) tall and 210 pounds (95 kg), Green achieved notoriety for his blunt manner. He possessed a booming voice and achieved many successes over a baseball career that lasted over 60 years.After his career as a pitcher, minor league manager, and farm system director, Green went on to manage the Phillies, New York Yankees and Mets for all or portions of eight seasons between 1979 and 1996. He led the Phillies to their third National League pennant and the first World Series title in their 97-year history in 1980, when they defeated the Kansas City Royals.
As general manager of the Chicago Cubs from 1981 to 1987, Green built the club that won a division title in 1984 — the Cubs' first postseason appearance in 39 years. In 1983, he was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame.
