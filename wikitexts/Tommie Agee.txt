Tommie Lee Agee (August 9, 1942 â€“ January 22, 2001) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a center fielder from 1962 through 1973, most notably as a member of the New York Mets team that became known as the Miracle Mets when, they rose from being perennial losers to defeat the favored Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 World Series for one of the most improbable upsets in World Series history. Agee performed two impressive defensive plays in center field to help preserve a Mets victory in the third game of the series.
A two-time Major League All-Star player, Agee was also a two-time Gold Glove Award winner and, was named the AL Rookie of the Year in 1966 as a member of the Chicago White Sox. He also played for the Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros and the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2002, Agee was posthumously inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame.
