Moreno threw a sharp slider, a changeup and a cutter, but had a good command of his low-90s fastball. He made his majors debut in the 1999 season, ranking as one of the top Royals prospects, but he injured his arm in an off-field accident and aggravated it by pitching.
Moreno had surgery performed and rehabbed at Triple-A in 2002, but then he showed up out of shape from the long layoff and was released. Soon after that, he signed with the Mets, pitching for them from 2003 to 2004.
In between, Moreno pitched 12 years in the Minor Leagues, including stints with the Diablos Rojos del México, Dorados de Chihuahua and Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican League, and for the Leones del Caracas club of the Venezuelan Winter League during 12 seasons from 1996–2013.
