Carlos Obed Ortiz Baerga (; Spanish: [baˈeɾɣa]; born November 4, 1968) is a Puerto Rican former Major League Baseball player. Baerga was known for his superb hitting abilities during his first stint with the Cleveland Indians in the early-to-mid-1990s, accumulating impressive batting statistics, earning three All-Star appearances (1992, 1993, 1995), two Silver Slugger Awards (1993, 1994), and making key contributions to the Indians' 1995 postseason run. He was considered one of Major League Baseball's hardest-hitting middle infielders by 1995 with his superb bat speed and switch-hitting power. After spending most of his career as a second baseman, he was used at various positions late in his career.  Baerga was elected into the Indians Hall of Fame in 2013.
