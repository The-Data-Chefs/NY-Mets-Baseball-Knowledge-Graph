Richard William Tidrow (May 14, 1947 â€“ July 10, 2021) was an American professional baseball pitcher and the senior vice president of player personnel and senior advisor to the general manager for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB).Originally a starting pitcher when he came up to MLB with the Cleveland Indians in 1972, he was moved into the bullpen by New York Yankees manager Bill Virdon toward the end of the 1974 season. He acquired his nickname, "Dirt", while playing for the Yankees, for his somewhat unkempt appearance and his tendency to get his uniform shirt dirty even before the start of a game.
