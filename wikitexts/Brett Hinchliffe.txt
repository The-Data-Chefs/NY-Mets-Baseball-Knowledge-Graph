Brett Hinchliffe (born July 21, 1974) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He was born with a genetic defect called syndactylism, a condition wherein two or more digits are fused together. As a result, the middle finger of his left hand was amputated as a child, and the bone was inserted into his thumb.
