He led the American League with 21 wins in 1956  and ranked second in the same category with 23 wins in 1961.  Lary was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1960 and 1961 and won the Gold Glove Award in 1961.  He was known variously as "Taters", "Mule", and the "Yankee Killer."  The latter nickname was won due to his 27–10  record against the New York Yankees from 1955 to 1961.
