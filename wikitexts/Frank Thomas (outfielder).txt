Frank Joseph Thomas (June 11, 1929 â€“ January 16, 2023) was an American outfielder and third baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for seven National League (NL) teams from 1951 to 1966. He was a three-time All-Star.
Beginning his career as a center and left fielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Thomas hit 30 home runs with 102 runs batted in (RBIs) in his first full season in 1953 before being named to the All-Star team each of the next two seasons. He had career highs of 35 home runs and 109 RBIs in 1958, and was named the starting third baseman for the All-Star Game. Thomas was traded after that season, however, in the first of four trades in three years. He continued his productivity, hitting at least 20 home runs in all but one season between 1953 and 1962.
After being acquired by the expansion New York Mets, he led the team with 34 home runs and 94 RBIs in their first season in 1962. His hitting declined after that year, and he ended his career playing for five clubs in his last three seasons. By the end of his career, Thomas had played every infield and outfield position except shortstop, and his 163 home runs with the Pirates placed him second in team history at the time behind Ralph Kiner. His 34 home runs with the 1962 Mets remained the team record until 1975, and his 94 RBIs that year were the team's top mark until 1970.
