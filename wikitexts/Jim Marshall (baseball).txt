Rufus James Marshall (born May 25, 1931) is an American former professional baseball player, manager and coach. He spent five full years in Major League Baseball as a first baseman, outfielder and pinch hitter for five teams from 1958 through 1962. Then he played in Japan (with the Chunichi Dragons) from 1963 to 1965. After his playing career, Marshall managed the Chicago Cubs (1974–76) and the Oakland Athletics (1979) but never enjoyed a winning season in either post. His career big-league managing record was 229–326 (.413) and his 1979 A's squad lost 108 of 162 games (.333).
