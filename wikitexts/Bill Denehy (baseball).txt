William Francis Denehy (born March 31, 1946) is an American former professional baseball pitcher and coach. Denehy threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) tall, and weighed 200 lb (91 kg). He was born in Middletown, Connecticut and attended Middletown Woodrow Wilson High School.
The second-ever Middletown Little League alumnus to play Major League Baseball, he signed with the New York Mets out of high school for a $20,000 bonus and made his professional debut with the Auburn Mets of the New Yorkâ€“Penn League (then Class A) in 1965. He led the league in wins with 13, and the following season won nine of 11 decisions with the Double-A Williamsport Mets of the Eastern League, compiling a stellar 1.97 earned run average. In 1967, Denehy made 15 Major League appearances for the Mets, dropping seven of eight decisions with an ERA of 4.67. The 1967 Mets finished in tenth and last place, the fifth cellar-dwelling team in the expansion club's six-year history.
