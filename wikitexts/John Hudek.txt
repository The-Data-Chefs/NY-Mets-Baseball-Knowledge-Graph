John Raymond Hudek (born August 8, 1966) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher. He played all or part of six seasons in the majors, from 1994 until 1999, for five different teams. He appeared in a total of 194 major league games, all in relief, making the 1994 NL All-Star team as a rookie. Once, in a game on September 5, 1997, he was tasked to pitch against Brian Johnson with runners on. With two strikes, catcher Tony Pena seemed to call for an intentional walk before Hudek threw a pitch in the middle of the zone for a strike that struck-out Johnson. He is currently a baseball coach at a Houston area school.
