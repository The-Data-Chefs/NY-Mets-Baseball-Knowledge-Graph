He was a member of the expansion Washington Senators during their maiden season in the American League, then moved on to the Orioles, where he would play four full seasons and establish himself as a top pinch hitter. In 1964 he led the American League with 45 pinch hit at bats and 15 pinch hits. Three years later, in 1967, Johnson collected 13 pinch hits in 34 at-bats in a  season split between the Orioles and the National League's New York Mets.Although Johnson's career batting average was only .272, he twice hit over .340 as a part-time player, for the 1967 Mets (.348) and the 1969 Athletics (.343).  During the latter season, Johnson made 14 pinch hits in 50 at bats, in a season divided between Oakland and the St. Louis Cardinals. 
In the field, Johnson played every infield position: shortstop (201 games), second base (167), third base (166) and first base (107).  He collected 66 pinch hits in 243 career at bats — to match his career overall batting average of .272.Johnson died on November 12, 2019 at age 83.

Johnson was traded along with Jackie Hernández and Jim Campanis from the Royals to the Pirates for Freddie Patek, Bruce Dal Canton and Jerry May at the Winter Meetings on December 2, 1970. He was a member of the 1971 World Series champion Pirates. The 1971 season was also his most productive, finishing 9–10 with a 3.45 ERA, including 27 starts, seven complete games and one shutout.
The Pirates faced the San Francisco Giants in the National League Championship Series that year, and with the 5-game series tied 1–1 after two games, Johnson started Game 3. He out-dueled Juan Marichal at Three Rivers Stadium, pitching eight innings and allowing only one unearned run for the win. The Pirates went on to win Game 4 to reach the World Series for the first time in 11 years. Johnson did not fare as well in the World Series, losing Game 2 at Memorial Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles.
An alumnus of Bradley University, for his career he compiled a 28–34 record with a 3.48 ERA and 507 strikeouts in 183 appearances, including 76 starts, 18 complete games, two shutouts, 12 saves and 6921⁄3 innings pitched. He garnered 15 hits in 157 at-bats for an .096 lifetime batting average.

Robert Lane "Bob" Miller (February 18, 1939 – August 6, 1993) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from 1957 to 1974. Miller played for three World Series champions: the 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers, 1965 Los Angeles Dodgers and the 1971 Pittsburgh Pirates—five league champions (the above three plus the 1966 Los Angeles Dodgers and the 1973 New York Mets) and four division winners, as well as for four teams that lost 100 or more games in a season.Miller played for ten teams during his major league career, tying a modern-day record (since 1900) with Dick Littlefield that has since been broken. He played with three teams in each of three seasons: the Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs in 1970; the Cubs, San Diego Padres and Pittsburgh Pirates in 1971; and the Padres, Detroit Tigers and New York Mets in 1973.Steve Treder of the Hardball Times described Miller as a "whatever-is-needed utility pitcher". Former teammate Roy Hartsfield, who managed the Toronto Blue Jays when Miller was the team's pitching coach, called him "The Christian", a nickname he earned "because he suffers so much", noting that Miller was a part-time reliever with a sore arm, but that "when we came up with some other sore arms on the staff he would come in and suffer a few innings."His 12 consecutive losses at the start of the 1962 season with the Mets stood as a club record until it was broken by Anthony Young in 1993.

Charles Robert Moorhead (January 23, 1938 – December 3, 1986) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the New York Mets in 1962 and 1965. He was born in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and was listed as 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and 208 pounds (94 kg).

An original Met, he made his major league debut in the franchise's first official game, played on April 11, 1962 at Busch Stadium. He was one of four pitchers used by manager Casey Stengel in the 11–4 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. In three innings, he allowed five runs (although only two were earned), on six hits and one base on balls.In his two-season MLB career, Moorhead posted an 0–3 record in 47 games pitched, with 68 strikeouts and a 4.51 ERA in 1192⁄3 innings.

Robert John Rauch (born June 16, 1949) is a former right-handed Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the New York Mets in 1972.
Originally signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1967, after attending Eisenhower High School and San Bernardino Valley College he began his professional career with the Ogden Dodgers that very year. His performance was lackluster, as he went 1-1 with a 9.45 ERA in 20 innings, allowing 25 hits and 26 walks. On a positive note, he did strike out 24 batters.
The following year, again with the Ogden Dodgers, Rauch went 1-2 with a 4.66 ERA in 29 innings. In 1969, playing for the Rogue Valley Dodgers and Bakersfield Dodgers, Rauch went a combined 6-4 with a 4.55 ERA. With Rogue Valley, he struck out 72 batters in 62 innings, although with Bakersfield, he struck out only 19 batters in 31 innings.
Pitching for Bakersfield again in 1970, he went 4-4 with a 2.82 ERA and 91 strikeouts in 83 innings of work. On November 30, 1970, he was drafted by the Mets in the minor-league draft. In his first year in their minor league system - 1971 - he had perhaps the best season of his career when he went a combined 9-5 with a 2.10 ERA while splitting time between the Memphis Blues and Tidewater Tides. His numbers would have been better if he had not pitched for the Tides that year - while with the Blues, he went 9-4 with a 1.48 ERA. With the Tides, his record was 1-0 and his ERA was 4.76.
In 1972, Rauch had another impressive year, pitching for the Tides and earning a call up to the Mets. In 21 games with the Tides, he went 1-2 with a 2.72 ERA. He made his big league debut on June 29 of that year, at the age of 22. Facing the Philadelphia Phillies, he pitched one inning, allowing 2 hits, 2 walks and a run. The Mets overall did poorly that game, losing 9-4. The opposing pitcher - Steve Carlton - pitched a complete game, striking out 13 batters. In his one and only big league season, Rauch went 0-1 with a 5.00 ERA in 19 relief appearances. He played in his final big league game on October 2.
Rauch was traded with Brent Strom from the Mets to the Cleveland Indians for Phil Hennigan at the Winter Meetings on November 27, 1972. He never actually appeared in an Indians uniform.

He had two seasons in which he collected thirty home runs and thirty stolen bases, making him one of thirteen players to have achieved the 30–30 club twice in a career. Through 2014, Abreu led active ballplayers in doubles (565), walks (1,456), and outfield assists (136), was fifth in runs scored (1,441) and stolen bases (400), seventh in extra-base hits (911) and on-base percentage (.396), and tenth in runs batted in (1,363). He is also one of only seven players ever to record at least 900 career extra-base hits and steal at least 400 bases along with Barry Bonds, Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, Craig Biggio, Honus Wagner, and Paul Molitor. Of these, five are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

Roberto Martin Antonio Bonilla (, born February 23, 1963) is an American former professional baseball third baseman and outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1986 to 2001.
Bonilla was one of the Major League's best batters and overall top players in the late 1980s and early 1990s with powerful hitting strength, as well as a part of the highly successful and pennant contending Pittsburgh Pirates organization around the same time. Bonilla recorded impressive statistics in home runs, RBIs, doubles, extra base hits, Wins Above Replacement averages, as well as four All-Star selections, three Silver Slugger Awards and was a top candidate for the National League's Most Valuable Player award during his tenure with the Pirates. He led the league in extra base hits (78) during the 1990 MLB season and doubles (44) during the 1991 MLB season.
Bonilla signed with the New York Mets during the 1991-92 offseason, becoming the highest-paid player in the league at the time, earning more than $6 million per year. However he struggled to live up to expectations with the Mets (which made the contract the subject of much criticism) and throughout the rest of his career. He played with the Baltimore Orioles from 1995-1996, reaching the American League Championship Series with the team in 1996.  He earned two additional All-Star appearances and helped the Florida Marlins win the 1997 World Series.  After being traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers part way through the 1998 season, he signed for a second time with the New York Mets in 1999.  When the Mets wanted to release him at the end of the year, he negotiated a settlement whereby the Mets would pay him $1.19 million every year from 2011 through 2035 on July 1, a date that has become known in Mets fandom as "Bobby Bonilla Day".  After two more lackluster seasons, one each with the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals, he retired at the end of the 2001 season.  Through his 16 years in professional baseball, Bonilla accumulated a .279 batting average, with a .358 on-base percentage and a .472 slugging percentage.

Robert Francis Klaus (born December 27, 1937), is a former right-handed Major League Baseball infielder who played from 1964 to 1965 for the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets. He is the brother of the late MLB infielder Billy Klaus.
Prior to playing professional baseball, Klaus attended University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Klaus was 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and weighed 170 pounds (77 kg).
Originally signed as an amateur free agent by the Cincinnati Redlegs in 1959, Klaus made his big league debut on April 21, 1964, against Jimmy Wynn and the rest of the Houston Colt .45s as a pinch hitter for pitcher Jim O'Toole. He did not get an official at-bat in his first game, because a runner on base was caught trying to advance.
Klaus did poorly as a brief replacement for Pete Rose in 1964 with the Reds, batting .183 in 40 games. He was purchased by the Mets on July 19 of that year, and with them he played in 56 games, compiling a .244 batting average. Overall, in 96 games in his rookie season, he batted .225.
1965 would end up being Klaus' final season in the big leagues. In 119 games with the Mets, he collected 55 hits in 288 at-bats for a .191 batting average. He showed a fair eye at the plate, with his walk total nearly matching his strikeout total – he had 45 and 49 respectively.
He played his final big league game on October 3, 1965, against the Philadelphia Phillies. He ended his career on a sour note – he collected no hits in five at bats in his final game.
In his big league career, he played in 215 total games, collecting 123 hits in 590 at-bats for a .208 batting average. He hit 25 doubles, four triples and six home runs, scored 65 runs and drove 29 in, stole five bases and was caught 10 times, and walked 74 times and struck out 92 times. He committed 21 errors in the field for a .973 fielding percentage.
Statistically, he is most similar to Buddy Biancalana.
Although his big league career ended after the 1965 season, he still stuck around in pro baseball for a while, and was part of some notable transactions. On February 22, 1966, he was traded by the Mets with Wayne Graham and Jimmie Schaffer to the Phillies for Dick Stuart.
On December 2, 1968, he was drafted by the San Diego Padres from the Phillies in the rule 5 draft.
Finally, on March 28, 1969, he was traded by the Padres with Ron Davis to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Tommie Sisk and Chris Cannizzaro.

Robert Allen Parnell (born September 8, 1984) is an American former baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets and Detroit Tigers. He was drafted by the Mets in the ninth round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft after attending Charleston Southern University.

Robert Raymond Pfeil (born November 13, 1943), is an American former professional baseball third baseman,  who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1969 and 1971 for the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies, respectively. He threw and batted right-handed.
Pfeil attended Reseda High School, making the varsity team his junior year.Originally signed as an undrafted free agent by the Chicago Cubs in 1961, Pfeil was traded with Hal Gilson to the St. Louis Cardinals for Bob Humphreys on April 7, 1965. Before the start of the 1968 season, Pfeil was sent from the Cardinals to the New York Mets, in an unknown transaction.
Pfeil made his big league debut at the age of 25 on June 26, 1969, against Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Grant Jackson. Pfeil went 1-for-4 in his debut, although Jackson shut the Mets out 2-0 and held them to just four hits, while striking out ten. Pfeil did well during the first two weeks of his rookie campaign; he was hitting .333 on July 4, but by July 31, Pfeil’s batting average had fallen to .232. (Coincidentally, .232 turned out to be his 1969 season’s final batting average.) After July 31, Pfeil was able to pull his average above .240 only once, with a low point of .217. However, after going 3-for-6 in the final two games of the season, Pfeil brought his average up to its final mark of .232. In 211 at-bats, he also scored 20 runs, drove 10 runs in, doubled nine times, walked seven times, and struck out 27 times.
Although the Mets reached the playoffs and eventually won the World Series in 1969, Pfeil did not appear in the playoffs or the fall classic. However, when President Nixon attended a World Series game, Pfeil lent him his glove for protection.On May 26, 1970, Pfeil was sent as the player to be named later to the Phillies to complete a trade that had occurred originally April 10, 1970. In return for Pfeil, the Mets received Ron Allen.
Pfeil didd not appear in the major leagues in 1970. In 1971 he was back in a big league uniform. Pfeil appeared in 44 games for the Phillies that year, collecting 19 hits in 70 at-bats for a .271 batting average. As he had made his MLB debut against the Phillies while playing for the Mets, it was ironic that Pfeil ended up facing the Mets while playing for the Phillies in his final career at-bat on September 5, 1971. Pfeil then played his final game, appearing as a defensive replacement against the Cardinals on September 6, 1971.
In Pfeil‘s big league career he played in 106 games, collecting 68 hits in 281 at-bats for a .242 batting average. Pfeil had 12 doubles and two home runs to go along with 25 runs, 19 RBI, one stolen base, 13 walks and 36 strikeouts. He had a .976 career fielding percentage.
Although Pfeil did not play in the majors after 1971, he remained an active minor league player. On February 8, 1972, Pfeil was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for a player to be named later, who ended up being minor leaguer Chico Vaughns. On March 20 of that year, Pfeil was purchased by the Boston Red Sox from the Brewers.

Bobby Gene Smith (May 28, 1934 – November 24, 2015) was an American professional baseball player, an outfielder who appeared in 376 games in the Major Leagues between 1957–1965 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets and Los Angeles Angels. He threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 180 pounds (82 kg).
Smith was an original member of the Mets, drafted with the 32nd selection in the 1961 Major League Baseball expansion draft. However, he only spent the first two weeks of the 1962 season with the team, playing in eight games, including five as a starting outfielder, before being dealt to the Cubs on April 26, then sent on to his original team, the Cardinals, on June 5, spending the rest of that campaign as a late-inning replacement for veteran Cardinals superstar Stan Musial in left field.
In 1958, he was one of three Bob Smiths in the Majors, along with pitchers Robert Gilchrist Smith of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Robert Walkup "Riverboat" Smith of the Boston Red Sox. During his career, outfielder Smith was frequently referred to as Bobby Gene Smith by baseball writers to prevent confusion.
Smith's 234 Major-League hits included 35 doubles, five triples and 13 home runs. His best year in the big leagues was in 1960, when he was the Phillies' semi-regular left fielder. That year, Smith reached personal bests in hits (62), home runs (4), runs batted in (27) and batting average (.286). He also batted over .300 during his ten-year minor-league career, which ended in 1967.

He was a three-sport athlete at Chaska High School, and after his senior year in 2008, the Florida Marlins selected him in the second round of the 2008 MLB Draft. Hand chose to forego a college baseball commitment to Arizona State in favor of turning professional. He made his MLB debut in 2011 when Marlins starting pitcher Josh Johnson was injured, but inconsistent pitch command prevented Hand from becoming a fixture in the Marlins' major league roster until 2014, when he was assigned to the bullpen. Hand spent the next two seasons alternating between starting and relief roles for Miami before he was claimed on waivers by the Padres shortly before the 2016 season.
Hand had a breakout role in San Diego, attributed in part to his slider. He was named to three consecutive All-Star Games beginning in 2017, the same year that he became a closer. The Padres traded Hand to the Indians midway through the 2018 season, and he made his first postseason appearance in the 2018 American League Division Series. After struggling with arm fatigue and pitch delivery issues in 2019, Hand was perfect in 16 save opportunities for Cleveland in 2020, but he was designated for assignment at the end of the year. Hand found varying levels of success in 2021 with Washington, Toronto, and New York before signing with Philadelphia in 2022.

Born in Havana, he threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 165 pounds (75 kg).
Fernández began his career in 1951 as a bright prospect for the Dodgers, reaching the Triple-A level in his third professional season. In 1954, he was the International League's All-Star shortstop, then he batted a career-best .301 in 1955. But he was not able to break into the Dodger lineup, which featured future Baseball Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese as shortstop and anchor of its infield. After 31⁄2 years at Triple-A, Fernández finally was recalled to Brooklyn in July 1956. He started at shortstop for ten games between July 14–22 (with Reese, 37, moving to third base), but he batted only .231 with no extra-base hits. The Dodgers, en route to the National League (NL) pennant, went 6–4 over that span, but Reese returned to shortstop on July 24, and Fernández started only five more games through the end of the 1956 season. He did not appear in the 1956 World Series, won by the New York Yankees in seven games.
On April 5, 1957, Fernández was traded to the Phillies in exchange for five players: pitcher Ron Negray, Canadian-born first baseman Tim Harkness, outfielder and pinch hitter Elmer Valo, minor-leaguer Mel Geho, a player to be named later (pitcher Ben Flowers), and $75,000. Fernández made his first appearance with Philadelphia on April 16, 1957, and was the Phillies' regular shortstop for two seasons. In 1957, Fernández collected 131 hits, for a .262 batting average (BA), and a .302 on-base percentage. He also stole 18 bases, fifth best in the National League. In 1958, Fernández stole 12 bases, placing him ninth in the NL. His batting average dropped over the next two seasons, and he saw limited playing time in 1959, hitting .211.
In December 1959, the Phillies traded Fernández to the Detroit Tigers, where he became the Tigers' regular shortstop for the next three seasons (1960–1962). In 1960, he led American League (AL) shortstops, with 34 errors; his fielding percentage was .947. By 1962, he increased his fielding percentage to .960.  Perhaps more surprisingly, Fernández displayed power as a hitter, in 1962. After six seasons in which he never hit more than six home runs, Fernández socked 20 homers and tallied 59 runs batted in that season. Both were career highs.
With a young Dick McAuliffe ready to assume the shortstop position for the Tigers, Detroit traded Fernández to the New York Mets in May 1963. He played 58 games for the 1963 Mets. Fernández was then traded to the Chicago White Sox in April 1964, but he never appeared in a regular season game for the ChiSox. 
In 1965, he played one season in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Hanshin Tigers.Fernández died on June 11, 2016, in Sunrise, Florida, at the age of 84, from complications following a stroke he had suffered the month before.

Wilmer Dean Chance (June 1, 1941 – October 11, 2015) was an American professional baseball player. A right-handed pitcher, he played in 11 Major League Baseball seasons for the Los Angeles / California Angels, Minnesota Twins, Cleveland Indians, New York Mets and Detroit Tigers. With a touch of wildness and the habit of never looking at home plate once he received the sign from his catcher, Chance would turn his back fully towards the hitter in mid-windup before spinning and unleashing a good fastball, sinker or sidearm curveball.In 1964, Chance became at the time the youngest pitcher to win the Cy Young Award when, as a member of the Los Angeles Angels, he led the American League in wins (20), innings pitched (2781⁄3) and earned run average (1.65—as of 2015, a franchise record) and was third in the A.L. in strikeouts. He pitched 11 shutouts (also a franchise record as of 2015) that season, winning five of those by a 1–0 score. At the time, only one Cy Young Award was given in all of MLB; since 1967, separate awards have been given in the AL and the National League. Chance's Cy Young Award was the third in a string of five consecutive Cy Young Awards won by a pitcher from a Los Angeles-based team. The others were won by Dodger pitchers: Don Drysdale in 1962 and Sandy Koufax in 1963, 1965, and 1966.

Bennett batted and threw left-handed, stood 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall, and weighed 192 pounds (87 kg). He was the older brother of Dave Bennett, a right-handed pitcher who appeared in one MLB game as Dennis's 1964 Phillies teammate.
Bennett was born in Oakland, California, raised in the Shasta Valley town of Yreka, near the Oregon border, and attended Yreka High School. He was signed by the Phillies in 1958 after attending Shasta College and played four full seasons in their farm system before being promoted to the Majors from Triple-A in May 1962. He had a strong rookie campaign, appearing in 31 games, including 24 starts, winning nine contests with seven complete games and two shutouts. He struck out 149 hitters in 1742⁄3 innings pitched and reached double figures in strikeouts in four games. But he was seriously injured in a car accident in January 1963 while playing winter baseball in Puerto Rico, delaying his 1963 debut until June 23. Nevertheless, he again won nine games as the Phillies finished in the first division for the first time since 1955.

He was the Phillies' opening day starting pitcher in 1964 against the Mets and did not record a decision in a game the Phils eventually won, 5–3, behind reliever Johnny Klippstein. Bennett took a regular turn in the 1964 Phillies' starting rotation but a lingering shoulder injury, a leftover from his winter 1963 car accident, began to limit his effectiveness in the season's final weeks. In late September, during the Phillies' disastrous ten-game losing streak that knocked them out of first place, Bennett lost his only two starts: September 23 against the Cincinnati Reds and then six days later against the St. Louis Cardinals.  In November, he was traded to the Red Sox for slugging first baseman Dick Stuart.
A sore arm plagued Bennett during his Red Sox tenure: he made 42 starts in almost 2+1⁄2 years, with the lone highlight a complete game, 4–0 shutout against the Angels on May 1, 1967—a game in which Bennett helped his own cause with a three-run home run off Jorge Rubio. He had another complete game win against the Angels on May 30 (a five-hit, 6–1 triumph), but a little more than three weeks later, he was traded on waivers to the Mets. During his half-season with Boston, he contributed four wins to the 1967 Red Sox, who unexpectedly won the American League pennant on the season's final day.
After going 1–1 with the 1967 Mets, Bennett played at the Triple-A level in the Chicago Cubs' organization before landing with the 1968 Angels, where he went winless in five decisions over the season's final two months. In a seven-season MLB career and in 182 games pitched, Bennett posted a 43–47 record with 572 strikeouts and a 3.69 ERA in 863 innings pitched, including six shutouts and 28 complete games. He played in the minors into 1973 before retiring from the game.

In the top of the eighth inning, he was replaced by pinch hitter Joe Christopher.  Chicago won the game 2–1 in extra innings.The rest of his career would be spent in minor league baseball, continuing in the Mets' system through 1970 and then retiring after a stint with the 1971 Omaha Royals.

Eduardo Bauta Galvez (January 6, 1935 – July 6, 2022) was a Cuban-born professional baseball player. A right-handed relief pitcher, he worked in 97 games in Major League Baseball as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals (1960–1963) and New York Mets (1963–1964). Bauta was born in Florida, Camagüey Province, Cuba. He was listed as 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall and 200 pounds (91 kg).
Bauta's pro career extended for 14 seasons, from 1956–1964, 1967–1969 and 1972–1973. Originally signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates, he was sent to the Cardinals in a May 1960 trade that had a positive impact on both teams. The Pirates received starting pitcher Vinegar Bend Mizell, who helped them win the 1960 National League pennant. Along with Bauta, the Cardinals got a minor league second baseman whose path to the majors was blocked by a future Baseball Hall of Famer, Bill Mazeroski. The young second baseman, Julián Javier, would play for the Cardinals for a dozen seasons, make two National League All-Star teams, and help St. Louis win three pennants and two World Series championships.
Bauta pitched sporadically for the 1960 Cardinals, getting into nine games and picking up his first MLB save. He began 1961 with Triple-A Portland, where in 35 games he won nine of ten decisions and compiled a stellar 1.95 earned run average. The Cardinals recalled him in July and used him in 13 games. He won two and lost none, allowed only 12 hits and three earned runs in 191⁄3 innings pitched (for a 1.40 ERA), and was credited with five saves. In 1962, he started strongly, with a 1.88 earned run average in 14 appearances through June 10. Then he was treated roughly in three appearances against the Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies, sending his ERA soaring to 5.01.  After June 30, he was sent to Triple-A Atlanta to regain his form.
That set the stage for Bauta's only full year in the majors, 1963. Again, he was effective through mid-season; on July 1, after 28 games, he had posted a 1.70 ERA. Then, over ten July appearances, it climbed by over two full runs, to 3.98. Ron Taylor and Bobby Shantz took over as the Redbirds' main relievers. Seeking another left-hander for their bullpen, the contending Cardinals traded Bauta to the last-place Mets for Ken MacKenzie on August 5. Bauta worked in 17 games for the Mets over the 1963 and 1964 seasons, all in relief, but was ineffective: he lost his only two decisions, posted a poor 5.28 ERA, and recorded only one save. The Mets sent him to Triple-A at the May 1964 cutdown, and he never appeared again in the big leagues, although he worked in the high minors for the rest of his professional career.
In his 97 major league games, Bauta compiled a 6–6 win–loss record and 11 saves, with a 4.35 earned run average. He allowed 148 hits and 70 bases on balls in 149 innings pitched, with 89 strikeouts.

Glynn stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 180 pounds (82 kg). He is one of the few players in the history of the Mets who grew up in the neighborhood where the team has played since 1964, Flushing, Queens. When Glynn was a student at Francis Lewis High School, he sold hot dogs at Shea Stadium during Mets' games in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As a result, when he later played for the Mets at Shea, the team honored him in a pre-game ceremony in which he was presented with an official Shea Stadium hot dog.Glynn, however, was bypassed by his hometown team when he graduated from high school in 1971, signing as an undrafted free agent with the Detroit Tigers on September 25, 1971. He worked his way up through the Tiger farm system for four seasons, until he won 11 games in a 1975 season split between the Montgomery Rebels and the Evansville Triplets. On September 19, 1975, he made his Major League debut in relief against the eventual American League champion Boston Red Sox. Entering the game in the fourth inning of a 4–4 tie, he struck out the year's AL Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year, Fred Lynn, to snuff out a Boston rally, but one inning later gave up the winning runs on a two-run single by Rico Petrocelli, as Boston won 7–5. Nine days later, Glynn made his first MLB start, lasting six innings against the Milwaukee Brewers and allowing three earned runs. He took the loss, however, as the Tigers were shut out by Larry Anderson.
Glynn spent 1976–1978 bouncing between Detroit and the Tigers' Triple-A Evansville affiliate, and was acquired by the Mets during spring training of 1979.  Starting the year with the Triple-A Tidewater Tides, Glynn was effective in 17 relief appearances and was recalled by the Mets to make his National League debut on June 1, 1979. He earned a save in his maiden NL appearance, working a scoreless 11th inning against the Atlanta Braves and preserving a 5–4 victory for Skip Lockwood. He worked in 46 games, all in relief, that season, and collected a career-high seven saves. Then, he spent the full 1980 season with the Mets — his only full season in the Majors.  Traded to the Indians  just prior to the opening of 1981 season, he spent much of that year in Triple-A but returned to Cleveland in May 1982 to work in a career-high 47 games and earn five victories in seven decisions.  He then began 1984 with the Indians, but was ineffective and returned to the minor leagues. His final Major League appearances came in relief in May 1985 for the Expos.  He retired for the 1988–1989 seasons before attempting a brief comeback with the Tidewater Tides in 1990. All told he pitched in 17 pro seasons.
As a big leaguer, Glynn allowed 261 hits and 151 bases on balls in 264+2⁄3 innings pitched. He struck out 184 and earned 12 total saves.  His career ERA was 4.33 and career WHIP was 1.557.

Mantilla's numbers improved dramatically in the hitter-friendly Fenway Park: batting average of .315 in 66 games (1963); .289 with 30 home runs (1964) (five fewer than he had hit in his career prior to that season); a career-high with 92 RBI (1965). That season, he was also named to the American League (AL) All-Star team for the only time in his career. As the starting second baseman, he went hitless in two at-bats before being replaced by Bobby Richardson.
Prior to the start of the 1966 season, the Red Sox traded Mantilla to the Houston Astros for Eddie Kasko. Mantilla spent that year as a utility player before being released on November 28, 1966.
The Chicago Cubs signed Mantilla as a free agent before the start of the 1967 season; however, during spring training he suffered an Achilles tendon injury that required surgery. Mantilla never played a game for them and was released on July 6. He went to spring training with the Cubs in 1968 as a non-roster player; at the end of camp the Cubs signed him to a minor league contract, but he never appeared in another professional game.
Looking upon Mantilla‘s major league career stat line, he posed solid numbers, including a lifetime batting average of .261, with 89 home runs, and 330 RBI.
On May 26, 1959, in the 13th inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Milwaukee County Stadium, Mantilla ruined Harvey Haddix's bid for a perfect game. Leading off the inning, he hit a ground ball to third baseman Don Hoak, whose throw to first pulled Rocky Nelson off the bag for an error. (Mantilla had not even been in the starting lineup; he entered the game in the 11th after Del Rice had pinch-hit for Johnny O'Brien.)  Mantilla was sacrificed to second by Eddie Mathews, followed by an intentional walk to Hank Aaron. The following batter, Joe Adcock, hit one over the right-center field wall, just beyond the reach of right fielder Joe Christopher (who was making his Major League debut), for an apparent 3–0 victory. Mantilla scored the winning run, but Aaron, thinking the ball was still in play and that the game ended when Mantilla scored the winning run, rounded second and then headed for the dugout. Adcock, running out his home run, passed Aaron on the bases; as a result, the ruling from National League (NL) president Warren Giles was that Adcock's hit was a double (not a home run), only Mantilla's run counted and the final score was 1–0.Mantilla's Topps 1962 baseball card was featured in the 2000 film Skipped Parts as the top card in a stack being thrown into a fire as part of a right of passage/growing up event between a stern grandfather (R. Lee Ermey) and his grandson (Bug Hall).

He was acquired by the Tidewater Tides, then the Mets' Triple-A affiliate, from the Diablos Rojos del México for Orlando McFarlane on November 30, 1970.In the United States, he is probably best known for being part of the trade that sent Nolan Ryan and three others, including Estrada, from the New York Mets to the California Angels for Jim Fregosi. However, he was one of the biggest stars in the history of Mexican baseball. While he played in just one game in the major leagues, Estrada holds the minor league record for games caught (2,847), and played for 26 seasons in the Mexican League, beginning his career there in 1966 and ending it in 1994.

He struck out 2,773 batters in his career and twice won playoff-clinching games for the teams he was on, the 1979 Angels and the 1987 Tigers.
Raised in northwest Detroit, Tanana was a first-round draft pick by the Angels in 1971. He made his debut with the team in 1973 and won 14 games his rookie year. Tanana and fellow starter Nolan Ryan formed one of the toughest pairs of starting pitchers to hit against in baseball. Tanana led the American League (AL) in strikeouts in 1975, then made the AL All-Star team three years in a row. He won 19 games in 1976 and led the AL with a 2.54 earned run average (ERA) in 1977. In 1979, he won the game that clinched the Angels' first-ever playoff appearance. Injuries began to take their toll on him by the end of his tenure with the Angels, and he changed his style from relying on a hard fastball to throwing a repertoire of slower pitches, using deception to get hitters out instead.
Tanana was traded to Boston for the 1981 season; he went 4–10 with the Red Sox before becoming a free agent and signing with the Rangers. He tied for the AL lead in losses his first year with Texas, then failed to make their starting rotation at the beginning of the 1983 season, though he returned to it in June. In 1984, he had a 15–15 record for the team, his most wins since 1978. After getting off to a poor start with Texas in 1985, he was traded to Detroit, the team he rooted for growing up.  Tanana would stay with the Tigers through 1992, pitching eight seasons with the club. He threw a shutout in the final game of the 1987 season to clinch a playoff spot for the team, winning 15 games that year. In 1988, he won 14 games; in 1989, he posted a 3.58 ERA. He was removed from the rotation for a time in 1990, only winning nine games that year, but the next season, he became the Tigers' first pitcher besides Jack Morris to start on Opening Day since 1979. This was the fifth Opening Day start of Tanana's career, as he had made four for the Angels in the 1970s. He won 13 games apiece in 1991 and 1992 before pitching one more season with the Mets and the Yankees in 1993.
After becoming a born-again Christian in November 1983, Tanana became a leader among baseball's Christian community. He has continued to serve in the ministry following his retirement, serving as an elder in his church, assisting the Tigers' chaplain, and performing Bible studies and marriage counselling. He lives in Farmington Hills, Michigan.

Frank Joseph Thomas (June 11, 1929 – January 16, 2023) was an American outfielder and third baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for seven National League (NL) teams from 1951 to 1966. He was a three-time All-Star.
Beginning his career as a center and left fielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Thomas hit 30 home runs with 102 runs batted in (RBIs) in his first full season in 1953 before being named to the All-Star team each of the next two seasons. He had career highs of 35 home runs and 109 RBIs in 1958, and was named the starting third baseman for the All-Star Game. Thomas was traded after that season, however, in the first of four trades in three years. He continued his productivity, hitting at least 20 home runs in all but one season between 1953 and 1962.
After being acquired by the expansion New York Mets, he led the team with 34 home runs and 94 RBIs in their first season in 1962. His hitting declined after that year, and he ended his career playing for five clubs in his last three seasons. By the end of his career, Thomas had played every infield and outfield position except shortstop, and his 163 home runs with the Pirates placed him second in team history at the time behind Ralph Kiner. His 34 home runs with the 1962 Mets remained the team record until 1975, and his 94 RBIs that year were the team's top mark until 1970.

Frank John Viola Jr. (born April 19, 1960) is an American former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Minnesota Twins (1982–1989), New York Mets (1989–1991), Boston Red Sox (1992–1994), Cincinnati Reds (1995), and Toronto Blue Jays (1996). A three-time All-Star, he was named World Series MVP with the Twins in 1987 and won the AL Cy Young Award in 1988. He is the pitching coach of the High Point Rockers.
He batted and threw left-handed, and he was nicknamed "Sweet Music" – a nickname he picked up after a Minnesota sports writer declared that when Viola pitched, there was "Sweet Music" in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The nickname was a play on the fact that his last name is also a name of a musical instrument, although pronounced differently. A fan began displaying a banner bearing the phrase in the outfield's upper deck whenever Viola pitched. Twins fans considered the banner to be a good luck charm.  The banner is now the property of the Minnesota Historical Society. It was again displayed when Viola was inducted into the Twins Hall of Fame. He was honored as a member of the Twins' "All Dome" team in 2009.

He played in the Phillies minor league system from 1990–1996, playing for the Martinsville Phillies (1990–1991), Batavia Clippers (1992), Spartanburg Phillies (1993), Clearwater Phillies (1993–1994), Reading Phillies (1994–1995), Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons (1995–1996).
Bennett made his major league debut in 1995 for the Phillies on September 24 against the Cincinnati Reds as a pinch hitter. He was signed as a free agent by the Boston Red Sox in 1997 season and spent the season with the Pawtucket Red Sox. He returned to the Phillies organization the following year as a minor league free agent. Played most of the season with Scranton before his contract was purchased by the Phillies in September. 1998 was his first full season in the majors and he stayed with the Phillies as a backup catcher to Mike Lieberthal until he was traded to the New York Mets for fellow catcher Todd Pratt on July 23, 2001. Bennett played in one big league game for the Mets (going 1–1) before they traded him to the Colorado Rockies a month later. He stayed with the Rockies in 2002, having over 200 at-bats in a season for the first time in his major league career. He then signed free agent deals with the San Diego Padres for 2003 (where he eclipsed the 300 at-bat mark for the first time and set a career-high in RBI, with 42), Milwaukee Brewers for 2004, Washington Nationals for 2005, and St. Louis Cardinals for 2006.Bennett came alive in late August 2006. He hit four home runs in the span of a week, including a walk-off grand slam against the Chicago Cubs on August 27, 2006. The four home runs equaled his career high of four home runs in a single season, which he did with the 2002 Colorado Rockies. He hit no other home runs that season. In an exhibition game on March 30, 2007, against the Memphis Redbirds, the Cardinals AAA Minor League affiliate, Bennett, with the game tied 2–2, hit grand slam in the top of the 8th inning, giving the Cardinals the victory. This led many fans to call him, "Gary Grand Slam Bennett".On November 28, 2006, Bennett was re-signed by the Cardinals.On November 2, 2007, the Cardinals exercised their 2008 buy-out option on his contract.On December 13, 2007, Bennett was named in the Mitchell Report, which detailed his illegal use of performance-enhancing substances such as human growth hormone.
On December 17, 2007, the Dodgers signed Bennett to a one-year deal to back up Russell Martin, the Dodgers' young All-Star catcher. After signing, Bennett publicly admitted that the Mitchell Report was accurate as far as he was concerned, stating, "As far as the report is concerned to me, it's accurate. Obviously, it was a stupid decision. It was a mistake." Bennett's 2008 season was cut short, however, when he went on the disabled list in mid-May for plantar fasciitis. The ailment would keep Bennett on the disabled list the remainder of the season. Veteran backup Danny Ardoin took Bennett's spot in his absence as Martin's backup. Bennett finished the 2008 campaign with a disappointing .190 batting average with one home run and four RBI in only 10 games played. After the season the Dodgers bought out Bennett's option year, making him a free agent.

Memphis manager Johnny Antonelli said of him before 1972 the season started "He's got good speed and a good arm. I wasn't worried about his defensive ability after watching him in the Instructional League. His hitting has been very satisfactory since he reported to us. So he has a chance to make the club. It depends a great deal on who Tidewater sends to us."  He was added to the Mets' 40 man roster after the 1972 season.In spring training of 1973 he competed with Don Hahn, Rich Chiles and Dave Schneck to backup 42 year old expected-starter Willie Mays in center field for the Mets, but ended up being sent down to the Blues before being recalled to the Mets in September.

They'd never seen a crowd like this. I think it scared them a little.In 1974 Harts began the season with the AAA Tidewater Tides but was sent down to the AA Victoria Toros after batting less than .200 in 35 games with Tidewater.  Harts was outrighted to Tidewater at the end of the season, removing him from the Mets' 40 man roster. An attempt to become a pitcher in the minor leagues in 1975 did not result in a major league pitching career.He was nicknamed "The Peanut Man."

An alumnus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, he signed a $100,000 bonus contract with his hometown Braves in 1957.

Still, Milwaukee won the National League pennant and drew the New York Yankees as their opponents in the 1957 World Series.

Such victories were rare, as the Mets won only 40 games all season. The two hits were the last of DeMerit's career: he retired at age 26, rather than report to Triple-A when the Mets attempted to farm him out a few days later.
For his career, DeMerit hit .174 with 23 hits, three doubles, three home runs and seven runs batted in in 93 games played.

Born and raised in Gary, Indiana, Hawkins was a seventh-round draft pick of the Twins out of high school. He debuted with the team in 1995 and reached the major leagues for good in 1997. After posting some of the worst earned run averages (ERA) in the American League (AL) in 1998 and 1999, Hawkins was moved to the bullpen in 2000. He struggled as the Twins' closer in 2001 but found better success thereafter in a setup role, posting a career-low 1.86 ERA in 2003 and reaching the playoffs in 2002 and 2003 with Minnesota.
In 2004, the Cubs signed Hawkins to setup for closer Joe Borowski, but he blew several saves and became unpopular with the team's fans. He was traded to the Giants in 2005 and served as a setup man again for various teams for the next few seasons. He reached the World Series with the Rockies in 2007, though the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox in four games.

Lawrence Lee Elliot (born March 5, 1938) is an American former professional baseball player. An outfielder, he appeared in 157 Major League games, all but 12 of them for the New York Mets (1964; 1966).  The native of San Diego, California, attended Herbert Hoover High School, alma mater of Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams; he threw and batted left-handed, stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg).
Elliot was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as a 20-year-old out of San Diego City College, and spent four years in the Bucs' farm system before making his Major League debut with Pittsburgh in 1962.  As a minor leaguer, Elliot had flashed home run power, hitting 16 homers in both 1958 and 1961, and 25 with the 1959 Wilson Tobs of the Class B Carolina League.Per the baseball rules then in force, Major League clubs could keep 28 players on their rosters for the first 30 days of the regular season, before cutting down to the 25-man active roster used until September 1.  Elliot received the first of his two early-season trials for Pittsburgh in April 1962, and appeared in eight games, including one as the club's starting right fielder, and collecting three hits in ten at bats.  In his eighth and final appearance, on May 3, he pinch hit for pitcher Diomedes Olivo and hit a home run off eventual 24-game-winner Jack Sanford of the San Francisco Giants. He then was sent down to the Triple-A Columbus Jets, where he hit 23 more home runs, but batted only .235 in 134 games.  He followed a similar pattern in 1963, making the Pirates out of spring training, appearing sparingly (four games as a pinch hitter), and then being sent to Columbus at the cutdown; that season, he hit 26 homers for the Jets. On December 16, 1963, the Pirates sold Elliot's contract to the Mets.
Although Elliot spent part of 1964 with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, hitting eight homers in 42 games, he spent most of the campaign in the Majors, getting into 80 games and starting 55 contests in center field in relief of Jim Hickman. On August 11, he gained a measure of revenge against his old team when he doubled and homered, drove in two runs, and led the Mets to a 3–2 victory over the Pirates in a game shortened by rain.  Elliot batted only .228 for the Mets, but hit nine homers in 256 at bats.  He then played the entire 1965 season in the minor leagues, but the Mets took some of the sting out of the demotion by loaning Elliot to his hometown San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, the Triple-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
He started 1966 with the Mets' Jacksonville Suns Triple-A club, batted a career-high .303 with 11 home runs in 73 games, and was recalled to New York in July.  Elliot continued his hot hitting during his early appearances, with a three-hit game (and four RBI) against the Houston Astros on July 18 pushing his batting average to .348.  But, although he started 53 games in corner outfield spots for the Mets through the end of season, his average eventually declined to .246.  Elliot began 1967 with Jacksonville; then, on May 10, the Mets traded him to the Kansas City Athletics in what would be a significant trade for them, as they received in return third baseman Ed Charles. Charles became a prominent member of the 1969 "Miracle Mets" and would be identified with the Mets for many years.  Elliot played three full seasons (1967–1969) at the Triple-A level before retiring.
In his 157 MLB games, Elliot had 103 hits, including 22 doubles, two triples and 15 home runs.

Larry Curtis Foss (April 18, 1936 – June 15, 2019) was an American professional baseball player and right-handed pitcher who appeared in eight games in Major League Baseball as a member of the 1961 Pittsburgh Pirates and the 1962 New York Mets expansion team. The native of Castleton, Kansas, stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 187 pounds (85 kg).
Foss graduated from Wichita West High School and attended Wichita State University. He began his pro career in the Pirates' system in 1955. After spending seven seasons in the minor leagues, he was recalled by Pittsburgh in September 1961 and made his MLB debut on September 18 as the Bucs' starting pitcher against the St. Louis Cardinals at Forbes Field. Over seven full innings, Foss allowed five hits and only one earned run, as the Pirates built an 8–1 lead. But in the eighth, Foss walked future Baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial and gave up a two-run home run to Gene Oliver and left the game with an 8–3 lead. When Pittsburgh held on to win, 8–6, Foss earned his first (and only) victory in the majors. The losing pitcher was another future Hall of Famer, Bob Gibson, then in his first full big-league season.Foss went back to the minors in 1962. After the Mets acquired him from Pittsburgh via waivers on September 6, Foss appeared in five  more National League games. He lost his only decision in his only start — which came on September 18, 1962, the anniversary of his victory over Gibson, and was also by an 8–6 final score. The 1962 Mets compiled a season record of 40–120, setting a post-1900 record for most losses by a Major League team in a single campaign. 
In Foss' eight MLB games, including four starts, he posted a 1–2 won–lost mark and a 5.33 earned run average. He permitted 32 hits and 18 walks in 27 career innings pitched, and registered 12 strikeouts. He left baseball after the 1963 minor-league season and died on June 15, 2019.

Larry Don Miller (June 19, 1937 – March 21, 2018) was an American professional baseball pitcher who appeared in 48 games in Major League Baseball for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1964) and New York Mets (1965–1966). Born in Topeka, he attended the University of Kansas, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering in 1960. He threw and batted left-handed, stood 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 195 pounds (88 kg).
Miller signed with the Dodgers in 1959 and spent three years in the club's farm system, and then missed the full 1962 and 1963 seasons while performing United States Army service. After starting 1964 with the Albuquerque Dukes, he was recalled by the Dodgers in June after he went 8–0 with a standout 1.68 earned run average in the Double-A Texas League. He was plugged into the 1964 Dodgers' starting rotation, with 14 starts among his 16 appearances. On August 2, he threw his only MLB complete game, a 6–1 triumph over the first-place Philadelphia Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium. He allowed seven hits and only one base on balls, and fanned five. Overall, as a rookie, he fashioned a 4–8 record and a 4.18 earned run average. Then in October he was swapped to the Mets for outfielder Dick Smith, a former Dodger farmhand. Hurling for the tail-ending Mets, Miller appeared in 32 games (with six starts) over parts of two seasons, but won only one of seven decisions with a poor 5.35 ERA. His final MLB game was September 17, 1966.Miller's final major league pitching line included a 5–14 won–lost record (for a winning percentage of .263) and an ERA of 4.71. In 1451⁄3 innings pitched, he allowed 162 hits and 57 walks; he struck out 93.
He then pitched three more seasons at the Triple-A level before leaving the game at age 32 after a nine-year professional baseball career. He settled in the Phoenix area and earned a masters' degree in engineering at Arizona State University. He spent three decades as a management consultant on major construction projects. Larry Miller died March 21, 2018, in Phoenix, aged 80.

Larry Floyd Stahl (born June 29, 1941) is an American retired professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball from 1964 to 1973 for the Kansas City Athletics, New York Mets, San Diego Padres, and Cincinnati Reds.
Stahl was signed by the Athletics in 1960 as an amateur free agent. He broke into the big leagues on September 11, 1964, going 0-1 as a pinch-hitter against Wally Bunker in a 5-2 Kansas City loss to the Baltimore Orioles in Memorial Stadium. After brief appearances in several more games, he notched his first career hit on September 19 at Yankee Stadium in an 8-3 loss to the New York Yankees. Pinch-hitting for pitcher Orlando Peña in the sixth inning, he hit a ground-rule double off Ralph Terry.Playing for the Padres on September 2, 1972, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Stahl drew one of the most questionable bases on balls in baseball history — if only because of the circumstances surrounding it. Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas had retired the first 26 Padres hitters and was one strike away from a perfect game with a 2-2 count against pinch-hitter Stahl. However, home plate umpire Bruce Froemming called the next two pitches, both of which were close, balls. To date, the perfect game bid is the only one in Major League history to be broken up by a walk to the 27th batter. Pappas secured his no-hitter by retiring Garry Jestadt one batter later.
Primarily an outfielder, his best year was 1971 at age 30 when, in 114 games for the Padres, he hit .253 with eight home runs and 36 runs batted in. He had exactly 400 career hits. His contract was purchased by the Reds on December 1, 1972. In his one postseason appearance, the 1973 National League Championship Series, playing for the Reds he had two hits in four at bats.

A southpaw used primarily in the major leagues as a relief pitcher, he stood 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) tall. He led the Yankees in wins in 1990 without starting a game.
Guetterman attended Liberty University, where he set several school records on the baseball team. Drafted by the Mariners in the fourth round of the 1981 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, he made his major league debut in 1984, though he would not return to the major leagues until 1986. After having the highest earned run average (ERA) of any American League (AL) pitcher with at least 75 innings pitched in 1986, he won 11 games as a starter in 1987, posting an 8–1 record at one point before getting moved to the bullpen due to a loss of control of his pitches. He was traded to the Yankees after the season, and after spending much of 1988 in the minor leagues, he emerged as a part-time closer for the Yankees in 1989, while Dave Righetti was struggling. He had 13 saves in 1989, then just two the following year, though he would lead the Yankees in wins. In 1991, however, Guetterman became unhappy with his playing time and requested a trade, which he got in 1992, when he was part of the only Yankees-Mets trade between 1987 and 2001.
After finishing the 1992 season with the Mets, Guetterman pitched for the Cardinals in 1993, though he was in the minor leagues until June 30 that year.

Fielding at shortstop, he commits an error on the first ball hit to him. After flying out in the 3rd inning, Foster hits into a double play in the 5th inning, followed by hitting into a triple play in the 7th inning.

Rohr played in the minor leagues until being called up to play for the Mets near the end of the 1967 season.
Rohr's first game was on September 19, 1967; starting against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Shea Stadium, he went six full innings and allowed only three runs, one of which was unearned, and was credited with the 6–3 victory. Eleven days later, he was even more effective, going eight shutout innings against Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium and gaining a 5–0 victory in which he defeated future Baseball Hall of Famer Don Drysdale.

Noah Seth Syndergaard (born August 29, 1992), nicknamed "Thor", is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the New York Mets, Los Angeles Angels and Philadelphia Phillies.
Born in Mansfield, Texas, Syndergaard did not establish himself as a baseball player for Mansfield Legacy High School until his senior year in 2010, where his pitch velocity was bolstered by a growth spurt and weight training regimen. Despite his strong season, Syndergaard's late development meant that he was mostly overlooked by scouts and college coaches, and he received only one college baseball scholarship offer. He turned down Dallas Baptist University, however, when the Toronto Blue Jays selected him in the first round, 38th overall, of the 2010 MLB Draft, he decided to sign. After three years in the Blue Jays' farm system, Syndergaard was traded with several other prospects to the Mets in exchange for reigning Cy Young Award winner R. A. Dickey. He made back-to-back appearances in the All-Star Futures Game in 2013 and 2014, but was left off of the Mets' September call-up list.
Syndergaard made his MLB debut in May 2015, following an injury to Dillon Gee. He impressed manager Terry Collins and remained in the starting rotation for the entire season. The Mets appeared that season in the 2015 World Series against the Kansas City Royals, with Syndergaard pitching in the team's only win of the series. The next year, Syndergaard was named a National League (NL) All-Star, and he became one of only five Mets pitchers to strike out 200 batters in one season before the age of 25. His 2017 and 2018 seasons were limited by injuries and illness, but he managed to start in 32 games for the Mets in 2019. During spring training in 2020, Syndergaard was diagnosed with an ulnar collateral ligament injury and had to undergo Tommy John surgery. He returned for only two innings at the end of the Mets' 2021 season. 
In 2022, Syndergaard rejected a qualifying offer from the Mets to sign a one-year, $21 million contract with the Angels. He was traded to the Phillies at the 2022 trade deadline and split time between the starting rotation and bullpen during the team's postseason run that culminated in an appearance in the 2022 World Series. Following the season, he signed a one-year, $13 million contract with the Dodgers for the 2023 season.

Lynn Nolan Ryan Jr. (born January 31, 1947), nicknamed "the Ryan Express", is an American former professional baseball pitcher and sports executive. Over a record 27-year playing career in Major League Baseball (MLB) spanning four decades, Ryan pitched for the New York Mets, California Angels, Houston Astros, and Texas Rangers. After his retirement in 1993, Ryan served as chief executive officer (CEO) of the Texas Rangers and an executive advisor to the Houston Astros. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest MLB pitchers of all time.
Ryan was a right-handed pitcher who consistently threw pitches that were clocked above 100 miles per hour (161 km/h). He maintained this velocity throughout his pitching career. Ryan was also known to throw a devastating 12–6 curveball at exceptional velocity for a breaking ball.Ryan had a lifetime win–loss record of 324–292 (.526) and was an eight-time All-Star. He has 5,714 career strikeouts, an MLB record that is 839 more than runner-up Randy Johnson. Similarly, Ryan's 2,795 bases on balls lead second-place Steve Carlton by 962 – walking over 50% more hitters than any other pitcher in MLB history. Ryan's lifetime batting average against of .204 is also a major league record. Ryan, Pedro Martínez, Randy Johnson, Trevor Hoffman, and Sandy Koufax are the only five pitchers inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame who had more strikeouts than innings pitched. Ryan is one of only three players in history to have his number retired by at least three teams, along with Jackie Robinson (whose number was retired by Major League Baseball) and Frank Robinson.
Ryan is the all-time leader in no-hitters with seven, three more than any other pitcher. He is tied with Bob Feller for the most one-hitters, with 12. Ryan also pitched 18 two-hitters. Despite this, he never pitched a perfect game, nor did he ever win a Cy Young Award; both were largely attributed to his high walk rate. Ryan is one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in MLB games in four different decades.

Paul's father was former major league first baseman Dick Siebert.The Houston Astros drafted Siebert in the third round of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft (58th overall, 7 ahead of Ron Guidry) out of Edina High School in Edina, Minnesota. He went 36-24 with a 2.86 earned run average over three seasons in Houston's farm system when he received a September call-up in 1974. He started in his major league debut on September 7 against the San Diego Padres, and exited after seven strong innings with a 4-2 lead the bullpen was unable to hold. In his next start, he shutout the San Francisco Giants on four hits. Siebert would not, however, win another game with the Astros. He would not make it out of the second inning in either of his next two starts (losing one), and went 0-2 each of the two following seasons. Just as pitchers and catchers were set to report for Spring training 1977, Siebert was dealt to the Padres for a minor league pitcher.
Siebert began the 1977 season with the triple A Hawaii Islanders, and was up in the majors for less than two weeks when he was part of the infamous "Saturday Night Massacre" in New York. On June 15, 1977, the Mets traded Dave Kingman to the San Diego Padres for Siebert and Bobby Valentine, sent Tom Seaver to the Cincinnati Reds for Pat Zachry, Doug Flynn, Steve Henderson and Dan Norman, and Mike Phillips to the St. Louis Cardinals for Joel Youngblood.Siebert split the rest of that year between the Mets and the minor league Tidewater Tides. He was the winning pitcher and scored the winning run in the Mets' seventeen inning extra innings marathon against the Montreal Expos on July 9. Coincidentally, his only other win and final career win also came in extra innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He would also split the 1978 season between the Mets and Tidewater, going 0-2 with a 5.14 ERA at the major league level.
Siebert was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for outfielder Bob Coluccio after the 1978 season, but neither would see any major league experience with his new club. Siebert was released at the end of Spring training 1979. Shortly afterwards, he signed with the Montreal Expos, going 1-3 with a 5.25 ERA for the Denver Bears of the American Association before retiring.

Pedro Martínez Aquino (born November 29, 1968), commonly but inaccurately referred to as Pedro A. Martínez (to distinguish him from the more famous Pedro Jaime Martínez), is a Dominican former Major League Baseball pitcher.

Pedro Jaime Martínez (born October 25, 1971) is a Dominican-American former professional baseball starting pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1992 to 2009, for five teams—most notably the Boston Red Sox from 1998 to 2004.
At the time of his retirement as an active player, his career record of 219 wins and 100 losses placed him fourth-highest in winning percentage in MLB history, and was the highest such achievement by a right-hander since the modern pitching era began, in 1903. Martínez ended his career with an earned run average (ERA) of 2.93, the sixth-lowest by a pitcher with at least 2,500 innings pitched, since 1920. He reached the 3,000 strikeout mark in fewer innings than any pitcher except Randy Johnson, and is the only pitcher to compile over 3,000 career strikeouts with fewer than 3,000 innings pitched; Martínez's career strikeout rate of 10.04 per nine innings trails only Johnson (10.61) among pitchers with over 1,500 innings.
An eight-time All-Star, Martínez was at his peak from 1997 to 2003, establishing himself as one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history. He won three Cy Young Awards (1997, 1999, 2000) and was runner-up twice (1998, 2002), posting a cumulative record of 118–36 (.766) with a 2.20 ERA, while leading his league in ERA five times and in winning percentage and strikeouts three times each. In 1999, Martínez was runner-up for the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player Award, after winning the pitching Triple Crown with a 23–4 record, 2.07 ERA, and 313 strikeouts, and—along with Johnson—joined Gaylord Perry in the rare feat of winning the Cy Young Award in both the American and National Leagues (a feat since accomplished by Roger Clemens, Roy Halladay, and Max Scherzer). He is also the record holder for the lowest single-season WHIP in major league history (0.737 in 2000), and is the record holder for the lowest single-season Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) in the live ball era (1.39 in 1999). Although his performance suffered a steep decline in 2004, Martínez ended the season memorably, by helping the Red Sox end a long drought in winning their first World Series title in 86 years.
Officially listed at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) and 170 pounds (77 kg), Martínez was unusually small for a modern-day power pitcher, and is believed to have been somewhat smaller than his officially listed height and weight. In his early 30s, injuries began to keep him off the field to an increasing extent, with his appearances and success dropping off sharply, in his final seasons. Modern sabermetric analysis has strongly highlighted Martínez's achievements; his WHIP is the lowest of any live-ball era starting pitcher, his adjusted ERA+ is the best of any starting pitcher in major league history, and he has the third-highest strikeout-to-walk ratio in modern history. He dominated while pitching most often in a hitter-friendly ballpark and facing some of the toughest competition during the steroid era, which is generally thought to have favored batters. His dominance, reflected by modern statistics, has led many to consider Martínez as one of the greatest pitchers in MLB history. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015 in his first year of eligibility, joining Juan Marichal as the second Dominican to be enshrined; his number (45) was retired by the Red Sox in a ceremony, two days after his Hall induction.

A 12-time stolen base champion, Henderson led the league in runs five times. His 25-year career elevated him to the top ten in several other categories, including career at-bats, games, and outfield putouts and total chances. His high on-base percentage, power hitting, and stolen base and run totals made him one of the most dominant and innovative players of all time. He was further known for his unquenchable passion for playing baseball and a buoyant, eccentric, and quotable personality that both perplexed and entertained fans.

Rodney Earl Gaspar (born April 3, 1946 in Long Beach, California, United States) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder.
A switch hitter, Gaspar  played for the New York Mets (1969–70) and San Diego Padres (1971, 1974).
A former player at Long Beach State and Long Beach City College, Gaspar played 178 games in his career, 118 of them in his rookie year, 1969. He began the year as the Mets’ starting right fielder, then became a utility outfielder (he also played left and center field on occasion) after Ron Swoboda became the regular right fielder. That year, he hit .228, recorded in 14 of his 17 career runs batted in, and hit his only Major League home run, off Mike McCormick of the San Francisco Giants on May 30. He also excelled defensively, leading all Mets outfielders in assists with 12, and leading the National League in double plays with six.
That year, Gaspar was a member of the Miracle Mets team that unexpectedly won the World Series in five games over the Baltimore Orioles. Before the Series, Orioles' outfielder, Frank Robinson said, "Bring on the Mets and Ron Gaspar!"  He was then told by his teammate, Merv Rettenmund, "It's Rod, stupid."  He then retorted by saying, "OK.  Bring on Rod Stupid!"  In Game Four of that Series, Gaspar scored the winning run on a controversial play at Shea Stadium. With the score tied at 1-1 in the bottom of the tenth, Gaspar pinch-ran for Jerry Grote, who had led off the inning with a double. An intentional walk to Al Weis followed, after which J. C. Martin, pinch-hitting for Tom Seaver, bunted to the pitcher. Both runners advanced, and as Martin ran to first, Pete Richert's throw hit him on the hand and ricocheted away, the error allowing Gaspar to score the winning run. (Replays would later show that Martin had been running inside the baseline, which could have resulted in him being called out for interference; however, the umpires said they didn't make the call because they felt Martin didn't intentionally interfere with the play.)

Roderick Edwin Kanehl (April 1, 1934 – December 14, 2004) was an American second baseman and outfielder in Major League Baseball who played his entire career with the New York Mets (1962–1964). Beloved by Mets fans, his attitude was exemplary for a team that lost a modern-era record 120 games in its inaugural season. Kanehl hit the first grand slam in Mets history on July 6, 1962, at the Polo Grounds.

Before making the major leagues, Kanehl played for eight seasons in the New York Yankees' and Cincinnati Reds' minor league systems. In 1962, at age 28, he was given an opportunity to try out for the Mets' opening season. Through spring training, he worked tirelessly for a spot on the roster. He leaped over an outfield wall in pursuit of a ball and he scored from second on a wild pitch. His attitude and all-out play earned him the nickname ′′Hot Rod′′.
Despite the objections and criticisms of the Mets' general manager George Weiss, manager Casey Stengel stuck with Kanehl. Stengel liked Kanehl's hustle and determination to play the game.
In a three-year career spanning 340 games, Kanehl batted .241 and accrued six home runs, 47 RBI, 103 runs, 23 doubles and 17 stolen bases. A highly versatile utilityman, he played every position except pitcher and catcher.
Kanehl played his final major-league season when Shea Stadium opened its doors in 1964. After the 1964 season, the Mets did not invite Kanehl to spring training, but also prevented him from taking a minor league coaching job he had been offered by the Yankee organization. He worked in construction, sold insurance, and later owned a restaurant. When Stengel died in 1975, Kanehl was the only former Mets player who was present at the funeral.
After suffering a heart attack, Kanehl died at a hospital in Palm Springs, California at age 70.

Taylor was involved in a rather peculiar situation in a game on June 30 of that year, between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Stan Musial was at the plate, with a count of 3–1. Pitcher Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, however Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. To Anderson's disappointment, the ball flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.Taylor slumped in 1960, hitting only .207 in 150 at-bats. He lost his starting catching role that year and played in only 74 games.
Taylor was the team's second most used catcher in 1961, behind Dick Bertell. In 1961, he hit .238 with eight home runs and 23 RBI in 235 at-bats (89 games).

In 1963—his final season—Taylor played for three different teams. He began the year with the Mets and hit .257 in 41 at-bats with them. On July 1, he was traded with Charlie Neal to the Reds for another catcher, Jesse Gonder. He played in three games for the Reds, collecting no hits in six at-bats.

Albert Shawn Gilbert Jr. (born March 12, 1965, in Camden, New Jersey) is an American former professional baseball player. He attended Agua Fria Union High School in Avondale, Arizona. After high school, he attended Fresno State and Arizona State University.
Gilbert was drafted four times by three different teams-the Dodgers, Reds and Twins, however it was not until their second try the Twins were able to finally sign him in 1987.
The 5'9", 185 pound Gilbert was not too imposing (some sources say he was as small as 170 pounds), but he held his own in the minors by using his small stature to swipe 40 or more bases in 3 out of 4 seasons between 1988 and 1991. He also hit .372 in 43 at-bats with Visalia in 1988.

Over the next few years, he bounced between the majors and minors but ended up swiping only 2 bases in 51 total major league games while hitting just .149.
An interesting fact about Gilbert's MLB career is in 51 games he only had 47 at-bats and scored more runs than he had actual hits. Rarely for someone to appear in 50 or more career games does anyone have more runs than hits and more games than at-bats. Two other examples of this are Charles Gipson and Glen Barker.
His last major league game was July 2, 2000, with the Dodgers.
He ended up retiring from professional baseball in 2003 at the age of 38 after playing for the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes in 2001, then in the Dodgers and Pirates farm systems in 2001, 2002, and 2003.

Green broke the record of 18 total bases (four home runs and double) set by Joe Adcock of the Milwaukee Braves (vs. Brooklyn Dodgers) in 1954.
At the time of his retirement, he was one of only four active players with at least 300 home runs, 1,000 runs and RBIs, 400 doubles, a .280 batting average, and 150 stolen bases.  The others were Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Jr., and Gary Sheffield, each of whom was at least two years older than Green, with at least 1,400 more at bats (though in each case, the other three had considerably more home runs and, in the case of Bonds, far more doubles and runs scored too).

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Fernandez was proud of his roots and wore uniform number 50 in honor of Hawaii being the 50th state. The theme song to Hawaii Five-O was often played before his starts at Shea Stadium during his days with the Mets.
Fernandez had an unorthodox pitching motion with a hesitation at the end, followed by a sudden slingshot sidearm delivery. This deceptive motion, coupled with an effective curveball and a rising fastball, made him a major strikeout threat throughout his career. Fernandez's strikeouts were often commemorated by Mets' fans in the upper deck putting up taped signs marked with the letter "S" for Sid.
Fernandez has the fourth-lowest ratio of hits allowed per innings pitched in Major League history, behind only Nolan Ryan, Clayton Kershaw, and Sandy Koufax.

The following year was chaotic. Parsons began the 1964 season pitching at Triple-A Columbus, then was traded by Pittsburgh to the Houston Colt .45s in June. After he got into 19 games for Houston's Triple-A affiliate, the Oklahoma City 89ers, the June trade was cancelled and Parsons returned to the Pirates, who in turn sold his contract to the Mets. Parsons then worked in four September 1964 games, including a September 20 start against his former organization, Houston; Parsons went the distance and gave up only six hits but lost, 1–0.His only full year in the majors came in 1965, for the last-place Mets. Parsons appeared in 35 games, with 11 starting assignments. He lost ten of 11 decisions but his lone win was a complete game shutout against the Chicago Cubs July 5 at Shea Stadium in the second game of a doubleheader. He also registered his only MLB save that season; that came June 3 against his original team, the Pirates. His final appearance came in relief on September 9 at Cincinnati's Crosley Field.
Parsons compiled a 2–13 (.133) record and a 4.72 earned run average during his MLB career. In 40 games pitched (14 career starts), he allowed 135 hits and 25 bases on balls in 1141⁄3 innings pitched. He struck out 70 hitters.

He threw left-handed, batted right-handed, and was listed as 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and 180 pounds (82 kg).
In 1964, Hunter became the second Met pitcher to record two wins in a single day.  (Craig Anderson had performed the feat first in 1962.) On August 23, 1964, Hunter pitched at the back end of both games of a doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs at Shea Stadium. He gave up no hits or runs in 12⁄3 total innings pitched, and in both cases, the Mets rallied to give Hunter the win.  Hunter had only three wins for the Mets that season—four in his MLB career—and two came on a single day.Born in Newark, New Jersey, Hunter attended Wake Forest University and signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers in time for the 1955 season. He spent six full years in minor league baseball before making the Dodgers' opening-season 28-man roster in 1962. In his MLB debut, a mop-up assignment against the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park, Hunter entered the game in the sixth inning with Los Angeles trailing, 9–1; he was already the Dodgers' fourth pitcher of the day. He lasted two innings, but gave up ten runs, nine of them earned, on six hits and four bases on balls. He was removed for pinch hitter Frank Howard in the Dodgers' eighth inning. San Francisco ended up winning, 19–8.Hunter then was sent to the Triple-A Omaha Dodgers, spent a month in the American Association, and on May 25 was assigned to the Mets as the player to be named later in the December 15, 1961, trade in which Los Angeles acquired outfielder Lee Walls. He then worked in 27 games for the Mets, including six as a starting pitcher. He was credited with a complete game on June 20 in a rain-shortened, six-inning contest against the Milwaukee Braves at the Polo Grounds, but Milwaukee won 3–2 with Hunter absorbing the loss. It was the only complete game of Hunter's big-league career.
After Hunter spent the entire 1963 season and the outset of 1964 with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, he returned to the Mets in June 1964. In 41 games pitched, all of them in relief, he split six total decisions and recorded five saves. His professional career ended with Buffalo in 1965.
In Hunter's 69 MLB games and 114 innings pitched, he allowed 127 hits and 47 bases on balls; he struck out 63. He compiled a 4–9 win–loss mark and 5.68 earned run average, with five saves.
Hunter died on February 3, 2021, in Omaha, Nebraska.

Willie Howard Mays Jr. (born May 6, 1931), nicknamed "the Say Hey Kid" and "Buck", is a former center fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB). Regarded as one of the greatest players ever, Mays ranks second behind only Babe Ruth on most all-time lists, including those of The Sporting News and ESPN. Mays played in the National League (NL) between 1951 and 1973 for the New York/San Francisco Giants and New York Mets. Mays is the oldest living member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Mays joined the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League in 1948, playing with them until the Giants signed him once he graduated from high school in 1950, then won the Rookie of the Year Award in 1951 after hitting 20 home runs to help the Giants win their first pennant in 14 years. After spending most of the next two years in the United States Army during the Korean War, he was named the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1954 after winning the batting title with a .345 average and hitting 41 home runs. His over-the-shoulder catch of a Vic Wertz fly ball in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series is one of the most famous baseball plays of all time. The Giants swept the heavily favored Cleveland Indians for the lone World Series triumph of his career, and the team's last title before relocating to San Francisco after the 1957 season.
A 24-time All-Star, tying him for the second most in history, Mays became a perennial MVP candidate, finishing in the top six in the voting in eleven of the next twelve seasons. He led the NL in home runs four times and in slugging percentage five times while batting over .300 and posting 100 runs batted in (RBI) ten times each. In 1955 he made a run at the Triple Crown, leading the league with 51 home runs and finishing second in batting and RBI. He was the runner-up for the MVP in 1958 after hitting a career-high .347, and again in 1962 after leading the Giants to another World Series with 49 home runs and 141 RBI. By 1963, he was making over $100,000 a year, setting a record at the time with a $105,000 contract. He was again named the MVP in 1965 after hitting .317 with a league-leading 52 home runs, becoming the second NL player to hit 50 more than once and setting a franchise record that stood until Barry Bonds hit 73 in 2001. Mays was also at the forefront of a resurgence of speed as an offensive weapon in the 1950s, leading the league in stolen bases four times, triples three times and runs twice, with his 179 steals during the decade topping the major leagues; he was the first NL player to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in the same season, and the first player in history to reach both 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases. He held the NL record for career home runs from 1966 until Henry Aaron passed him during the 1972 season, during which time he became the second player and the first right-handed hitter to hit 600 home runs. Mays also set standards for defensive brilliance, winning 12 consecutive Gold Glove Awards after their creation in 1957, still a record for outfielders; he led NL center fielders in double plays five times and assists three times. He ended his career with a return to New York after a mid-season trade to the New York Mets in 1972, retiring after the team's trip to the 1973 World Series. He served as a coach for the Mets for the rest of the decade, and later rejoined the Giants as a special assistant to the president and general manager.
A classic example of a 5-tool player, Mays finished his career with a batting average of .302. Upon his retirement, he held the NL record for career runs scored (2,062), and ranked second in league history behind Stan Musial in games played (2,992), third in at bats (10,881), runs batted in (1,903), total bases (6,066), extra-base hits (1,323) and walks (1,464), fourth in hits (3,283), fifth in slugging percentage (.557), and eighth in doubles (523); his 140 triples ranked fourth among players active after 1945. He holds major league records for games as a center fielder (2,829), putouts as an outfielder (7,095) and extra-inning home runs (22), and ended his career behind only Ty Cobb in total games as an outfielder (2,842) and ranking seventh in assists (188) and third in double plays (59) in center field.
Mays was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979 in his first year of eligibility, and was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. President Barack Obama presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015.

Mizell was born in Leakesville, Mississippi, but started playing baseball in Vinegar Bend, Alabama, the town from which he drew his nickname. Signed by the Cardinals in 1949, he debuted with them in 1952, ranking among the Top 10 in the National League (NL) in strikeouts for two years before spending 1954 and 1955 in military service. He returned to the Cardinals in 1956 and was named to two Major League Baseball All-Star Games in 1959, but St. Louis felt like he never attained his full potential. They traded him to Pittsburgh early in the 1960 season, and Mizell led the NL in winning percentage (.636) as the Pirates defeated the New York Yankees in the 1960 World Series. He remained with the Pirates until early in the 1962 season, last pitching in the major leagues with the Mets.
While pitching for the Winston-Salem Cardinals in 1951, Mizell had settled in Midway, North Carolina. Six years after he threw his last major league pitch, he was elected to the House of Representatives, serving North Carolina's newly aligned 5th district. In three terms over the next six years, Mizell gained a reputation as a conservative. He opposed the Blue Ridge Power Project, introducing a House Bill in 1974 to add the New River to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Though the bill was unsuccessful at the time, it became law in 1976. Mizell, however, lost his seat to Stephen L. Neal in 1974, also losing to the Democrat when he ran against him in 1976. Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush each appointed him to Assistant Secretary positions within their administrations. After suffering a heart attack in 1998, Mizell died in 1999.

He made his major-league debut at age 21 in 1946 and was a mainstay in the Yankees' lineup during the team's championship years beginning in 1949 and continuing through 1962.

Wheeler was born to a baseball-playing family in Smyrna, Georgia, but moved to Dallas, Georgia, shortly before the start of high school. There, he pitched for East Paulding High School, leading the team to a state playoff appearance in 2009 and pitching a no-hitter against Mill Creek High School. The San Francisco Giants selected Wheeler sixth overall in the 2009 MLB Draft, and he elected to sign with the team rather than honoring his previous college baseball commitment for Kennesaw State. Wheeler played for the Giants' minor league teams in 2010 and 2011 before he was traded to the Mets in July 2011.
After the trade, Wheeler rose through the Mets' farm system, making his major league debut in 2013. His performance in 2013 and 2014 was considered a highlight of the Mets' overall disappointing seasons, but Wheeler's development came to a sudden halt after he tore his ulnar collateral ligament during spring training in 2015. He underwent Tommy John surgery for the injury, and was expected to return partway through the 2016 season, but a series of setbacks during the rehabilitation process kept Wheeler from returning to the mound until 2017.
Following a 2017 season that was limited by injury, Wheeler returned to form with the Mets in 2018, setting a career high number of strikeouts and innings pitched. He became a free agent at the end of the 2019 season, and signed a five-year deal with the Phillies in December 2019. Wheeler missed part of the shortened 2020 season with a fingernail injury, but impressed at the start of 2021, becoming the third pitcher in franchise history to strike out 10 or more batters in three consecutive starts.
